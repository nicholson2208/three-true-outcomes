# Sketch of how I might go about doing this actually


## Must do
- Schedule with github actions
- ~~Mastodon module to post~~
- ~~translate into a nice post~~
- ~~post one at a time~~
   - save history
- make the actual post not look dumb by messing with formatting and stuff



# Nice to have
- ~~ballpark overlay with the home runs~~
- season leaderboard
    - I think this would be recalced daily? because if it goes down, I am SOL
- Maybe make images for the Ks and BBs


# Low Priority
- would it dong cross over
