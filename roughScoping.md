# Sketch of how I might go about doing this actually


## Must do
- Schedule with github actions
- Mastodon module to post
- translate into a nice post
- post one at a time
   - save history



# Nice to have
- ballpark overlay with the home runs
- season leaderboard
    - I think this would be recalced daily? because if it goes down, I am SOL


# Low Priority
- would it dong cross over
